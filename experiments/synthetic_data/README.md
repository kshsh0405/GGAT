## Synthetic Data Generation

Synthetic datasets are generated based on Model 1 proposed in Appendix B of "Rethinking Graph Neural Networks From A Geometric Perspective Of Node Features" (Chen et al., 2023). According to this model, each node feature is initially sampled from a Bernoulli distribution, yielding binary values of 0 or 1. However, we observed that this formulation results in class labels being trivially predictable by GNNs, leading to near-perfect accuracy even in highly heterophilic regimes.

To address this limitation and create more challenging classification tasks, we introduce feature modification to the original model. We add Gaussian noise to each node feature independent of its class, thereby transforming the discrete binary features into continuous values and increasing the difficulty of class discrimination. This feature modification effectively prevent models from achieving perfect predictions while preserving the underlying structure of the synthetic dataset.

For graph construction, given a target number of edges and a desired homophily level $h \in [0, 1]$, we compute the number of homophilic edges as $|E_{homo}| = h \cdot |E|$ and heterophilic edges as $|E_{hetero}| = |E| - |E_{homo}|$. Homophilic edges are then generated by randomly sampling pairs of nodes belonging to the same class (intra-class edges), while heterophilic edges are created by randomly connecting nodes from different classes (inter-class edges). This procedure allows precise control over the graph's homophily ratio, enabling systematic evaluation of model performance across the full spectrum of homophily levels.
